LAB 2 PART A
Conversion Program Design

1. Define conversion rates
2. Receive input to be converted
3. Perform calculations
4. Display converted values

1a. 	Define conversion value for miles to kilometers as 1.6
1b(1). 	Define conversion value 1 for Fahrenheit to Celsius as 32
1b(2). 	Define conversion value 2 for Fahrenheit to Celsius as (5/9)
1c. 	Define conversion value for gallons to liters as 3.9
1d. 	Define conversion value for pounds to kilograms as 0.45
1e. 	Define conversion value for inches to centimeters as 2.54

2a. Prompt user to input number of miles to be converted
2b. Prompt user to input temperature in Fahrenheit to be converted
2c. Prompt user to input number of gallons to be converted
2d. Prompt user to input number of pounds to be converted
2e. Prompt user to input number of inches to be converted

3a. Calculate the number of kilometers as miles multiplied by the conversion value for miles
3b. Calculate the temperature in Celsius as the temperature in Fahrenheit minus conversion 
	value 1 for Fahrenheit multiplied by conversion value 2 for Fahrenheit. 
3c. Calculate the number of liters as gallons multiplied by the conversion value for gallons
3d. calculate the number of kilograms as pounds muliplied by the conversion value for pounds
3e. Calculate the number of centimeters as inches multiplied by the conversion value for inches

4a. Display the number of kilometers, rounded to two decimal places
4b. Display the temperature in Celsius, rounded to two decimal places
4c. Display the number of liters, rounded to two decimal places
4d. Display the number of kilograms, rounded to two decimal places
4e. Display the number of centimeters, rounded to two decimal places
