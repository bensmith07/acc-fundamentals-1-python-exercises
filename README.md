# ACC Programming Fundamentals I - Python Exercises

This repository will store the completed lab assignments from my Programming Fundamentals I course, taken at Austin Community College in Fall 2020. 

## Course Description

Introduces the fundamental concepts of structured programming. Topics
include software development methodology, data types, control structures, functions, arrays, and the mechanics of running, testing, and debugging.

This is an entry level programming course designed to teach students the basic concepts of computer programming. The course will include designing, coding, debugging, testing, and documenting programs using a high level programming language. The course is intended to prepare students for a programming-oriented academic path.

## Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes

1. Demonstrate problem solving skills by developing and implementing algorithms to solve problems.
2. Derive problem specifications from problem statements.
3. Develop algorithms using modular design principles to meet stated specifications.
4. Create code to provide a solution to problem statements ranging from simple to complex. 5. Test and debug programs and program modules to meet specifications and standards.
6. Create programs that contain clear and concise program documentation.
7. Implement programs that use data types and demonstrate an understanding of numbering systems.
8. Incorporate both basic and advanced control structures appropriately into algorithms.
9. Demonstrate an understanding of structure design by implementing programs with functions, including parameter passing and value returning.
10. Implement programs using classes, including strings and files.
11. Implement algorithms using one-dimensional and indexed data structures.
12. Demonstrate an understanding of array searching and sorting algorithms by desk-checking and/or modifying algorithm implementations.
13. Design and implement simple classes.

## File Organization / Naming Conventions

Each exercise includes a .pdf of the original instructions, as well as one or more files containing the completed code which was turned in for each assignment. The instruction file name includes the main topics of each assignment, and the code file names correspond to the relevant sections in the instruction file.
